:mod:`~aioxmpp.protocol` --- XML Stream implementation
######################################################

This module contains the :class:`XMLStream` class, which implements the XML
stream protocol used by XMPP. It makes extensive use of the :mod:`aioxmpp.xml`
module and the :mod:`aioxmpp.xso` subpackage to parse and serialize XSOs
received and sent on the stream.

In addition, helper functions to work with :class:`XMLStream` instances are
provided; these are not included in the class itself because they provide
additional functionality solely based on the public interface of the
class. Separating them helps with testing.

    The possible states of a :class:`XMLStream`:

    .. attribute:: READY

       The initial state; this is the case when no underlying transport is
       connected.

    .. attribute:: STREAM_HEADER_SENT

       After a :class:`asyncio.Transport` calls
       :meth:`XMLStream.connection_made` on the xml stream, it sends the stream
       header and enters this state.

    .. attribute:: OPEN

       When the stream header of the peer is received, this state is entered
       and the XML stream can be used for sending and receiving XSOs.

    .. attribute:: CLOSING

       After :meth:`XMLStream.close` is called, this state is entered. We sent
       a stream footer and an EOF, if the underlying transport supports
       this. We still have to wait for the peer to close the stream.

       In this state and all following states, :class:`ConnectionError`
       instances are raised whenever an attempt is made to write to the
       stream. The exact instance depends on the reason of the closure.

       In this state, the stream waits for the remote to send a stream footer
       and the connection to shut down. For application purposes, the stream is
       already closed.

    .. attribute:: CLOSING_STREAM_FOOTER_RECEIVED

       At this point, the stream is properly closed on the XML stream
       level. This is the point where :meth:`XMLStream.close_and_wait`
       returns.

    .. attribute:: CLOSED

       This state is entered when the connection is lost in any way. This is
       the final state.

class XMLStream(asyncio.Protocol):
    """
    XML stream implementation. This is an streaming :class:`asyncio.Protocol`
    which translates the received bytes into XSOs.

    `to` must be a domain :class:`~aioxmpp.structs.JID` which identifies the
    domain to which the stream shall connect.

    `features_future` must be a :class:`asyncio.Future` instance; the XML
    stream will set the first :class:`~aioxmpp.nonza.StreamFeatures` node
    it receives as the result of the future.

    `sorted_attributes` is mainly for unittesting purposes; this is an argument
    to the :class:`~aioxmpp.xml.XMPPXMLGenerator` and slows down the XML
    serialization, but produces deterministic results, which is important for
    testing. Generally, it is preferred to leave this argument at its default.

    `base_logger` may be a :class:`logging.Logger` instance to use. The XML
    stream will create a child called ``XMLStream`` at that logger and use that
    child for logging purposes. This eases debugging and allows for
    connection-specific loggers.

    Receiving XSOs:

    .. attribute:: stanza_parser

       A :class:`~aioxmpp.xso.XSOParser` instance which is wired to a
       :class:`~aioxmpp.xml.XMPPXMLProcessor` which processes the received
       bytes.

       To receive XSOs over the XML stream, use :attr:`stanza_parser` and
       register class callbacks on it using
       :meth:`~aioxmpp.xso.XSOParser.add_class`.

    .. attribute:: error_handler

       This should be assigned a callable, taking two arguments: a
       :class:`xso.XSO` instance, which is the partial(!) top-level stream
       element and an exception indicating the failure.

       Partial here means that it is not guaranteed that anything but the
       attributes on the partial XSO itself are there. Any children or text
       payload is most likely missing, as it probably caused the error.

       .. versionadded:: 0.4

    Sending XSOs:

    .. automethod:: send_xso

    Manipulating stream state:

    .. automethod:: starttls

    .. automethod:: reset

    .. automethod:: close

    .. automethod:: abort

    Signals:

    .. signal:: on_closing

       A :class:`~aioxmpp.callbacks.Signal` which fires when the underlying
       transport of the stream reports an error or when a stream error is
       received. The signal is fired with the corresponding exception as the
       only argument.

       If the stream gets closed by the application without any error, the
       argument is :data:`None`.

       By the time the callback fires, the stream is already unusable for
       sending stanzas. It *may* however still receive stanzas, if the stream
       shutdown was initiated by the application and the peer has not yet send
       its stream footer.

       If the application is not able to handle these stanzas, it is legitimate
       to disconnect their handlers from the :attr:`stanza_parser`; the stream
       will be able to deal with unhandled top level stanzas correctly at this
       point (by ignoring them).

    Timeouts:

    .. attribute:: shutdown_timeout

       The maximum time to wait for the peer ``</stream:stream>`` before
       forcing to close the transport and considering the stream closed.
