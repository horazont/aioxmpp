    Discover all connection options for a domain, in descending order of
    preference.

    This coroutine returns options discovered from SRV records, or if none are
    found, the generic option using the domain name and the default XMPP client
    port.

    Each option is represented by a triple ``(host, port, connector)``.
    `connector` is a :class:`aioxmpp.connector.BaseConnector` instance which is
    suitable to connect to the given host and port.

    `logger` is the logger used by the function.

    The following sources are supported:

    * :rfc:`6120` SRV records. One option is returned per SRV record.

      If one of the SRV records points to the root name (``.``),
      :class:`ValueError` is raised (the domain specifically said that XMPP is
      not supported here).

    * :xep:`368` SRV records. One option is returned per SRV record.

    * :rfc:`6120` fallback process (only if no SRV records are found). One
      option is returned for the host name with the default XMPP client port.

    The options discovered from SRV records are mixed together, ordered by
    priority and then within priorities are shuffled according to their weight.
    Thus, if there are multiple records of equal priority, the result of the
    function is not deterministic.

    The connection options in `override_peer` are tried before any standardised
    discovery of connection options is made. Only if all of them fail,
    automatic discovery of connection options is performed.

    current event loop.

    :class:`ValueError` is raised, too.

    If all connection attempts fail, :class:`aioxmpp.errors.MultiOSError` is
    raised. The error contains one exception for each of the options discovered
    as well as the elements from `override_peer` in the order they were tried.

    A TLS problem is treated like any other connection problem and the other
    connection options are considered. However, if *all* connection options

    Base class to implement an XMPP client.

    Args:
        local_jid (:class:`~aioxmpp.JID`): Jabber ID to connect as.
        security_layer (:class:`~aioxmpp.SecurityLayer`): Configuration
            for authentication and TLS.
        negotiation_timeout (:class:`datetime.timedelta`): Timeout for the
            individual stream negotiation steps (bounds initial connect time)
        override_peer: Connection options which take precedence over the

        max_inital_attempts (:class:`int`): Maximum number of initial
            connection attempts before giving up.
        loop (:class:`asyncio.BaseEventLoop` or :data:`None`): Override the
            :mod:`asyncio` event loop to use.
        logger (:class:`logging.Logger` or :data:`None`): Override the logger
            to use.

    These classes deal with managing the :class:`~aioxmpp.stream.StanzaStream`
    and the underlying :class:`~aioxmpp.protocol.XMLStream` instances. The
    abstract client provides functionality for connecting the xmlstream as well
    as signals which indicate changes in the stream state.

    The `security_layer` is best created using the
    :func:`aioxmpp.security_layer.make` function and must provide
    authentication for the given `local_jid`.

    If `loop` is given, it must be a :class:`asyncio.BaseEventLoop`
    instance. If it is not given, the current event loop is used.

    As a glue between the stanza stream and the XML stream, it also knows about
    stream management and performs stream management negotiation. It is
    specialized on client operations, which implies that it will try to keep
    the stream alive as long as wished by the client.

    The client will attempt to connect to the server(s) associated with the
    `local_jid`, using the prioritised `override_peer` setting or the
    standardised options for connecting (see :meth:`discover_connectors`). The
    initial connection attempt must succeed within `max_initial_attempts`.

    If the connection breaks after the first connection attempt, the client
    will try to resume the connection transparently. If the server supports
    stream management (:xep:`198`) with resumption, this is entirely
    transparent to all operations over the stream. If the stream is not
    resumable or the resumption fails and `allow_implicit_reconnect` is true,
    the application and services using the stream are notified about that. If,
    in that situation, `allow_implicit_reconnect` is false instead, the client
    stops with an error.

    The number of reconnection attempts is generally unbounded. The application
    is notified that the stream got interrupted with the
    :meth:`on_stream_suspended` is emitted. After reconnection,
    :meth:`on_stream_established` is emitted (possibly preceded by a
    :meth:`on_stream_destroyed` emission if the stream failed to resume). If
    the application wishes to bound the time the stream tries to transparently
    reconnect, it should connect to the :meth:`on_stream_suspended` signal and
    stop the stream as needed.

    The reconnection attempts are throttled using expenential backoff
    controlled by the :attr:`backoff_start`, :attr:`backoff_factor` and
    :attr:`backoff_cap` attributes.

    .. note::

       If `max_initial_attempts` is :data:`None`, the stream will try
       indefinitely to connect to the server even if the connection has
       never succeeded yet. This is may mask problems with the configuration of
       the client itself, because the client cannot successfully distinguish
       permanent problems arising from the configuration (of the client or the
       server) from problems arising from transient problems such as network
       failures.

       This may severely degrade usabilty, because the client is then stuck in
       a connect loop without any usable feedback. Setting a bound for the
       initial connection attempt is usually better, for interactive
       applications an upper bound of 1 might make most sense (possibly the
       interactive application may retry on its own if the user did not
       indicate that they wish to do so after a timeout). We’ll leave the UX
       considerations up to you.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4

       Since 0.4, support for legacy XMPP sessions has been implemented. Mainly
       for compatibility with ejabberd.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.8

       The amount of initial connection attempts is now bounded by
       `max_initial_attempts`. The :meth:`on_stream_suspended` signal and the
       associated logic has been introduced.

    Controlling the client:

    .. automethod:: connected

    .. automethod:: start

    .. automethod:: stop

    .. autoattribute:: running

    .. attribute:: negotiation_timeout
        :annotation: = timedelta(seconds=60)

        The timeout applied to the connection process and the individual steps
        of negotiating the stream. See the `negotiation_timeout` argument to
        :func:`connect_xmlstream`.

    .. attribute:: override_peer

       A sequence of triples ``(host, port, connector)``, where `host` must be
       a host name or IP as string, `port` must be a port number and
       `connector` must be a :class:`aioxmpp.connector.BaseConnctor` instance.

       These connection options are passed to :meth:`connect_xmlstream` and
       thus take precedence over the options discovered using
       :meth:`discover_connectors`.

       .. note::

          If Stream Management is used and the peer server provided a location
          to connect to on resumption, that location is preferred even over the
          options set here.

       .. versionadded:: 0.6

    .. autoattribute:: resumption_timeout
        :annotation: = None

    Connection information:

    .. autoattribute:: established

    .. attribute:: established_event

        An :class:`asyncio.Event` which indicates that the stream is
        established. A stream is valid after resource binding and before it has
        been destroyed.

        While this event is cleared, :meth:`enqueue` fails with
        :class:`ConnectionError` and :meth:`send` blocks.

    .. autoattribute:: suspended

    .. autoattribute:: local_jid

    .. attribute:: stream

       The :class:`~aioxmpp.stream.StanzaStream` instance used by the node.

    .. attribute:: stream_features

       An instance of :class:`~aioxmpp.nonza.StreamFeatures`. This is the
       most-recently received stream features information (the one received
       right before resource binding).

       While no stream has been established yet, this is :data:`None`. During
       transparent re-negotiation, that information may be obsolete. However,
       when :attr:`before_stream_established` fires, the information is
       up-to-date.

    Sending stanzas:

    .. automethod:: send

    .. automethod:: enqueue

    Configuration of exponential backoff for reconnects:

    .. attribute:: backoff_start
       :annotation: = timedelta(1)

       When an underlying XML stream fails due to connectivity issues (generic
       :class:`OSError` raised), exponential backoff takes place before
       attempting to reconnect.

       The initial time to wait before reconnecting is described by
       :attr:`backoff_start`.

    .. attribute:: backoff_factor
       :annotation: = 1.2

       Each subsequent time a connection fails, the previous backoff time is
       multiplied with :attr:`backoff_factor`.

    .. attribute:: backoff_cap
       :annotation: = timedelta(60)

       The backoff time is capped to :attr:`backoff_cap`, to avoid having
       unrealistically high values.

    Signals:

    .. signal:: on_failure(err)

       This signal is fired when the client fails and stops.

    .. syncsignal:: before_stream_established()

       This coroutine signal is executed right before
       :meth:`on_stream_established` fires.

    .. signal:: on_stopped()

       Fires when the client stops gracefully. This is the counterpart to
       :meth:`on_failure`.

    .. signal:: on_stream_established()

       When the stream is established and resource binding took place, this
       event is fired. It means that the stream can now be used for XMPP
       interactions.

    .. signal:: on_stream_suspended(reason)

       The stream has been suspened due to a connection failure.

       :param reason: The exception which terminated the stream.
       :type reason: :class:`Exception`

       This signal may be immediately followed by a
       :meth:`on_stream_destroyed`, if the stream did not support stream
       resumption. Otherwise, a new connection is attempted transparently.

       In general, this signal exists solely for informational purposes. It
       can be used to drive a user interface which indicates that messages may
       be delivered with delay, because the underlying network is transiently
       interrupted.

       :meth:`on_stream_suspended` is not emitted if the stream was stopped on
       user request.

       After :meth:`on_stream_suspended` is emitted, one of the two following
       signals is emitted:

       - :meth:`on_stream_destroyed` indicates that state was actually lost and
         that others most likely see or saw an unavailable presence broadcast
         for the resource.
       - :meth:`on_stream_resumed` indicates that no state was lost and the
         stream is fully usable again.

       .. versionadded:: 0.8

    .. signal:: on_stream_resumed()

        The stream has been resumed after it has been suspended, without loss
        of data.

        This is the counterpart to :meth:`on_stream_suspended`.

        In general, this signal exists solely for informational purposes. It
        can be used to drive a user interface which indicates that messages may
        be delivered with delay, because the underlying network is transiently
        interrupted.

        .. versionadded:: 0.11

    .. signal:: on_stream_destroyed(reason=None)

       This is called whenever a stream is destroyed. The conditions for this
       are the same as for
       :attr:`aioxmpp.stream.StanzaStream.on_stream_destroyed`.

       :param reason: An optional exception which indicates the reason for the
                      destruction of the stream.
       :type reason: :class:`Exception`

       This event can be used to know when to discard all state about the XMPP
       connection, such as roster information. Services implemented in
       :mod:`aioxmpp` generally subscribe to this signal to discard cached
       state.

       `reason` is optional. It is given if there is has been a specific
       exception which describes the cause for the stream destruction, such as
       a :class:`ConnectionError`.

       .. versionchanged:: 0.8

          The `reason` argument was added.

    Services:

    .. automethod:: summon

    Miscellaneous:

    .. attribute:: logger

       The :class:`logging.Logger` instance which is used by the
       :class:`Client`. This is the `logger` passed to the constructor or a
       logger derived from the fully qualified name of the class.

       .. versionadded:: 0.6

          The :attr:`logger` attribute was added.

        request, the response is awaited and the :attr:`~.IQ.payload` of the
        response is returned.

        If the stream is currently not ready, this method blocks until the
        stream is ready to send payload stanzas. Note that this may be before
        initial presence has been sent. To synchronise with that type of
        events, use the appropriate signals.

        The `timeout` as well as any of the exception cases referring to a
        "response" do not apply for IQ response stanzas, message stanzas or
        presence stanzas sent with this method, as this method only waits for
        a reply if an IQ *request* stanza is being sent.

        If `stanza` is an IQ request and the response is not received within
        `timeout` seconds, :class:`TimeoutError` (not
        :class:`asyncio.TimeoutError`!) is raised.

        If `cb` is given, `stanza` must be an IQ request (otherwise,
        :class:`ValueError` is raised before the stanza is sent). It must be a
        callable returning an awaitable. It receives the response stanza as
        first and only argument. The returned awaitable is awaited by
        :meth:`send` and the result is returned instead of the original
        payload. `cb` is called synchronously from the stream handling loop
        when the response is received, so it can benefit from the strong
        ordering guarantees given by XMPP XML Streams.

        The `cb` may also return :data:`None`, in which case :meth:`send` will
        simply return the IQ payload as if `cb` was not given. Since the return
        value of coroutine functions is awaitable, it is valid and supported to
        pass a coroutine function as `cb`.

        .. warning::

            Remember that it is an implementation detail of the event loop when
            a coroutine is scheduled after it awaited an awaitable; this
            implies that if the caller of :meth:`send` is merely awaiting the
            :meth:`send` coroutine, the strong ordering guarantees of XMPP XML
            Streams are lost.

            To regain those, use the `cb` argument.

        .. note::

            For the sake of readability, unless you really need the strong
            ordering guarantees, avoid the use of the `cb` argument. Avoid
            using a coroutine function unless you really need to.
