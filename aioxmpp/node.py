class AbstractClient:
    """
    The :class:`AbstractClient` is a base class for implementing XMPP client
    classes. These classes deal with managing the
    :class:`~aioxmpp.stream.StanzaStream` and the underlying
    :class:`~aioxmpp.protocol.XMLStream` instances. The abstract client
    provides functionality for connecting the xmlstream as well as signals
    which indicate changes in the stream state.

    The `jid` must be a :class:`~aioxmpp.structs.JID` for which to connect. The
    `security_layer` is best created using the
    :func:`~aioxmpp.security_layer.security_layer` function and must provide
    authentication for the given `jid`.

    The `negotiation_timeout` argument controls the :attr:`negotiation_timeout`
    attribute.

    If `loop` is given, it must be a :class:`asyncio.BaseEventLoop`
    instance. If it is not given, the current event loop is used.

    As a glue between the stanza stream and the XML stream, it also knows about
    stream management and performs stream management negotiation. It is
    specialized on client operations, which implies that it will try to keep
    the stream alive as long as wished by the client.

    In general, there are no fatal errors (aside from stream negotiation
    problems) which stop a :class:`AbstractClient` from working. It makes use
    of stream management as far as possible and abstracts away the gritty low
    level details. In general, it is sufficient to observe the
    :attr:`on_stream_established` and :attr:`on_stream_destroyed` events, which
    notify a user about when a stream becomes available and when it becomes
    unavailable.

    If authentication fails (or another stream negotiation error occurs), the
    client fails and :attr:`on_failure` is fired. :attr:`running` becomes false
    and the client needs to be re-started manually by calling :meth:`start`.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4

       Since 0.4, support for legacy XMPP sessions has been implemented. Mainly
       for compatiblity with ejabberd.

    Controlling the client:

    .. automethod:: start

    .. automethod:: stop

    .. autoattribute:: running

    .. attribute:: negotiation_timeout = timedelta(seconds=60)

       The timeout applied to the connection process and the individual steps
       of negotiating the stream. See the `negotiation_timeout` argument to
       :func:`connect_secured_xmlstream`.

    Connection information:

    .. autoattribute:: established

    .. autoattribute:: local_jid

    .. attribute:: stream

       The :class:`~aioxmpp.stream.StanzaStream` instance used by the node.

    .. attribute:: stream_features

       An instance of :class:`~aioxmpp.nonza.StreamFeatures`. This is the
       most-recently received stream features information (the one received
       right before resource binding).

       While no stream has been established yet, this is :data:`None`. During
       transparent re-negotiation, that information may be obsolete. However,
       when :attr:`before_stream_established` fires, the information is
       up-to-date.

    Exponential backoff on interruptions:

    .. attribute:: backoff_start

       When an underlying XML stream fails due to connectivity issues (generic
       :class:`OSError` raised), exponential backoff takes place before
       attempting to reconnect.

       The initial time to wait before reconnecting is described by
       :attr:`backoff_start`.

    .. attribute:: backoff_factor

       Each subsequent time a connection fails, the previous backoff time is
       multiplied with :attr:`backoff_factor`.

    .. attribute:: backoff_cap

       The backoff time is capped to :attr:`backoff_cap`, to avoid having
       unrealistically high values.

    Signals:

    .. signal:: on_failure(err)

       This signal is fired when the client fails and stops.

    .. syncsignal:: before_stream_established()

       This coroutine signal is executed right before
       :meth:`on_stream_established` fires.

    .. signal:: on_stopped()

       Fires when the client stops gracefully. This is the counterpart to
       :meth:`on_failure`.

    .. signal:: on_stream_established()

       When the stream is established and resource binding took place, this
       event is fired. It means that the stream can now be used for XMPP
       interactions.

    .. signal:: on_stream_destroyed()

       This is called whenever a stream is destroyed. The conditions for this
       are the same as for :attr:`.StanzaStream.on_stream_destroyed`.

       This event can be used to know when to discard all state about the XMPP
       connection, such as roster information.
