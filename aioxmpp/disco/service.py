class Node(object):
    """
    A :class:`Node` holds the information related to a specific node within the
    entity referred to by a JID, with respect to XEP-0030 semantics.

    A :class:`Node` always has at least one identity (or it will return
    as ``<item-not-found/>``). It may have zero or more features beyond the
    XEP-0030 features which are statically included.

    To manage the identities and the features of a node, use the following
    methods:

    .. automethod:: register_feature

    .. automethod:: unregister_feature

    .. automethod:: register_identity

    .. automethod:: unregister_identity

    To access the declared features and identities, use:

    .. automethod:: iter_features

    .. automethod:: iter_identities

    To access items, use:

    .. automethod:: iter_items

    Signals provide information about changes:

    .. signal:: on_info_changed()

       This signal emits when a feature or identity is registered or
       unregistered.

    As mentioned, bare :class:`Node` objects have no items; there are
    subclasses of :class:`Node` which support items:

    :class:`StaticNode`  Support for a list of :class:`.xso.Item` instances

    returned when a query is received for the JID with an empty or unset

       Upon construction, the :class:`Service` adds a default identity with
       category ``"client"`` and type ``"bot"`` to the root :class:`Node`. This
       is to comply with XEP-0030 of always having an identity and not being
