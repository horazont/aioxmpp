    """
    Enumeration of implementation quirks.

    Each enumeration member represents a quirk of an implementation. A quirk is
    a behaviour of an implementation which does not directly violate standards,
    but which is unfortunate in a way that it disables some features of
    :mod:`aioxmpp`.

    One example of such a quirk is the rewriting of message stanza IDs which
    some MUC implementations do when reflecting the messages. This breaks the
    stanza tracking of :meth:`aioxmpp.muc.Room.send_tracked_message`.

    The following quirks are defined:

    .. attribute:: MUC_REWRITES_MESSAGE_ID
       :annotation: https://zombofant.net/xmlns/aioxmpp/e2etest/quirks#muc-id-rewrite

       This quirk must be configured when the environment the provisioner
       provides rewrites the message IDs when they are reflected by the MUC
       implementation.

       The quirk does not need to be set if the environment does not provide a
       MUC implementation at all.

    .. attribute:: PUBSUB_GET_ITEMS_BY_ID_BROKEN
       :annotation: https://zombofant.net/xmlns/aioxmpp/e2etest/quirks#broken-pubsub-get-multiple-by-id

       Indicates that the "Get Items by Id" operation in the PubSub service used
       is broken when more than one item is requested.

    ``pin_store`` and ``pin_type`` can be used to configure certificate
    pinning, in case the server you want to test against does not have a
    certificate which passes the default OpenSSL PKIX tests.

    If set, ``pin_store`` must point to a JSON file, which consists of a single
    object mapping host names to arrays of strings containing the base64
    representation of what is being pinned. This is determined by ``pin_type``,
    which can be ``0`` for Public Key pinning and ``1`` for Certificate
    pinning.

    There is also the ``no_verify`` option, which, if set to true, will disable
    certificate verification altogether. This does not much harm if you are
    testing against localhost anyways and saves the configuration nuisance for
    certificate pinning. ``no_verify`` takes precedence over ``pin_store`` and
    ``pin_type``.
