        Wrapper around :func:`aioxmpp.ping.ping`.

        **When to use this wrapper vs. the global function:** Using this method
        has the side effect that the application will start to respond to
        :xep:`199` pings. While this is not a security issue per se (as
        responding to :xep:`199` pings only changes the format of the reply,
        not the fact that a reply is sent from the client), it may not be
        desirable under all circumstances.

        So especially when developing a Service which does not *require* that
        the application replies to pings (for example, when implementing a
        stream or group chat aliveness check), it is preferable to use the
        global function.

        When implementing an application where it is desirable to reply to
        pings, using this wrapper is fine.

        In general, aioxmpp services should avoid depending on this service.

        (The decision essentially boils down to "summon this service or not?",
        and it is not a decision aioxmpp should make for the application unless
        necessary for compliance.)
