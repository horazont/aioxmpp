        This is an implementation of :class:`~.AbstractConversation`. The

        extensive documentation there. This documentation here only provides
        a short synopsis for those members plus the changes with respect to
        the base interface.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.9

        In 0.9, the :class:`Room` interface was re-designed to match
        :class:`~.AbstractConversation`.

    The following properties are provided:

    .. autoattribute:: features

    .. autoattribute:: jid

    .. autoattribute:: me

    .. autoattribute:: members

    These properties are specific to MUC:

    .. autoattribute:: muc_active

    .. autoattribute:: muc_joined

    .. autoattribute:: muc_state

    .. autoattribute:: muc_subject

    .. autoattribute:: muc_subject_setter

    .. attribute:: muc_autorejoin

       A boolean flag indicating whether this MUC is supposed to be
       automatically rejoined when the stream it is used gets destroyed and
       re-estabished.

    .. attribute:: muc_password

       The password to use when (re-)joining. If :attr:`autorejoin` is
       :data:`None`, this can be cleared after :meth:`on_enter` has been
       emitted.

    The following methods and properties provide interaction with the MUC
    itself:

    .. automethod:: ban

    .. automethod:: kick

    .. automethod:: leave

    .. automethod:: send_message

    .. automethod:: send_message_tracked

    .. automethod:: set_nick

    .. automethod:: set_topic

    .. automethod:: muc_request_voice

    .. automethod:: muc_set_role

    .. automethod:: muc_set_affiliation

    The interface provides signals for most of the rooms events. The following
    keyword arguments are used at several signal handlers (which is also noted
    at their respective documentation):

    `muc_actor` = :data:`None`
       The :class:`~.xso.UserActor` instance of the corresponding
       :class:`~.xso.UserExt`, describing which other occupant caused the
       event.

       Note that the `muc_actor` is in fact not a :class:`~.Occupant`.

    `muc_reason` = :data:`None`
       The reason text in the corresponding :class:`~.xso.UserExt`, which
       gives more information on why an action was triggered.

    .. note::

       Signal handlers attached to any of the signals below **must** accept
       arbitrary keyword arguments for forward compatibility. For details see
       the documentation on :class:`~.AbstractConversation`.

    .. signal:: on_enter(**kwargs)

        Emits when the initial room :class:`~.Presence` stanza for the
        local JID is received. This means that the join to the room is complete;
        the message history and subject are not transferred yet though.

        .. seealso::

            :meth:`on_muc_enter`
                is an extended version of this signal which contains additional
                MUC-specific information.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.10

            The :meth:`on_enter` signal does not receive any arguments anymore
            to make MUC comply with the :class:`AbstractConversation` spec.

    .. signal:: on_muc_enter(presence, occupant, *, muc_status_codes=set(), **kwargs)

        This is an extended version of :meth:`on_enter` which adds MUC-specific
        arguments.

        :param presence: The initial presence stanza.
        :param occupant: The :class:`Occupant` which will be used to track the
            local user.
        :param muc_status_codes: The set of status codes received in the
            initial join.
        :type muc_status_codes: :class:`~.abc.Set` of :class:`int` or
            :class:`~.StatusCode`

        .. versionadded:: 0.10

    .. signal:: on_message(msg, member, source, **kwargs)

        A message occured in the conversation.

        :param msg: Message which was received.
        :type msg: :class:`aioxmpp.Message`
        :param member: The member object of the sender.
        :type member: :class:`.Occupant`
        :param source: How the message was acquired
        :type source: :class:`~.MessageSource`

        The notable specialities about MUCs compared to the base specification
        at :meth:`.AbstractConversation.on_message` are:

        * Carbons do not happen for MUC messages.
        * MUC Private Messages are not handled here; see :class:`MUCClient` for
          MUC PM details.
        * MUCs reflect messages; to make this as easy to handle as possible,
          reflected messages are **not** emitted via the :meth:`on_message`
          event **if and only if** they were sent with tracking (see
          :meth:`send_message_tracked`) and they were detected as reflection.

          See :meth:`send_message_tracked` for details and caveats on the
          tracking implementation.

        When **history replay** happens, since joins and leaves are not part of
        the history, it is not always possible to reason about the identity of
        the sender of a history message. To avoid possible spoofing attacks,
        the following caveats apply to the :class:`~.Occupant` objects handed
        as `member` during history replay:

        * Two identical :class:`~.Occupant` objects are only used *iff* the
          nickname *and* the actual address of the entity are equal. This
          implies that unless this client has the permission to see JIDs of
          occupants of the MUC, all :class:`~.Occupant` objects during history
          replay will be different instances.
        * If the nickname and the actual address of a message from history
          match, the current :class:`~.Occupant` object for the respective
          occupant is used.
        * :class:`~.Occupant` objects which are created for history replay are
          never part of :attr:`members`. They are only used to convey the
          information passed in the messages from the history replay, which
          would otherwise be inaccessible.

        .. seealso::

            :meth:`.AbstractConversation.on_message` for the full
            specification.

    .. signal:: on_presence_changed(member, resource, presence, **kwargs)

        The presence state of an occupant has changed.

        :param member: The member object of the affected member.
        :type member: :class:`Occupant`
        :param resource: The resource of the member which changed presence.
        :type resource: :class:`str` or :data:`None`
        :param presence: The presence stanza
        :type presence: :class:`aioxmpp.Presence`

        `resource` is always :data:`None` for MUCs and unavailable presence
        implies that the occupant left the room. In this case, only
        :meth:`on_leave` is emitted.

        .. seealso::

            :meth:`.AbstractConversation.on_presence_changed` for the full
            specification.

    .. signal:: on_nick_changed(member, old_nick, new_nick, *, muc_status_codes=set(), **kwargs)

        The nickname of an occupant has changed

        :param member: The occupant whose nick has changed.
        :type member: :class:`Occupant`
        :param old_nick: The old nickname of the member.
        :type old_nick: :class:`str` or :data:`None`
        :param new_nick: The new nickname of the member.
        :type new_nick: :class:`str`
        :param muc_status_codes: The set of status codes received in the leave
            notification.
        :type muc_status_codes: :class:`~.abc.Set` of :class:`int` or
            :class:`~.StatusCode`

        The new nickname is already set in the `member` object. Both `old_nick`
        and `new_nick` are not :data:`None`.

        .. seealso::

            :meth:`.AbstractConversation.on_nick_changed` for the full
            specification.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.10

            The `muc_status_codes` argument was added.

    .. signal:: on_topic_changed(member, new_topic, *, muc_nick=None, **kwargs)

        The topic of the conversation has changed.

        :param member: The member object who changed the topic.
        :type member: :class:`Occupant` or :data:`None`
        :param new_topic: The new topic of the conversation.
        :type new_topic: :class:`.LanguageMap`
        :param muc_nick: The nickname of the occupant who changed the topic.
        :type muc_nick: :class:`str`

        The `member` is matched by nickname. It is possible that the member is
        not in the room at the time the topic chagne is received (for example
        on a join).

        `muc_nick` is always the nickname of the entity who changed the topic.
        If the entity is currently not joined or has changed nick since the
        topic was set, `member` will be :data:`None`, but `muc_nick` is still
        the nickname of the actor.

        .. note::

            :meth:`on_topic_changed` is emitted during join, iff a topic is set
            in the MUC.

    .. signal:: on_join(member, **kwargs)

        A new occupant has joined the MUC.

        :param member: The member object of the new member.
        :type member: :class:`Occupant`

        When this signal is called, the `member` is already included in the
        :attr:`members`.

    .. signal:: on_leave(member, *, muc_leave_mode=None, muc_actor=None, muc_reason=None, **kwargs)

        An occupant has left the conversation.

        :param member: The member object of the previous occupant.
        :type member: :class:`Occupant`
        :param muc_leave_mode: The cause of the removal.
        :type muc_leave_mode: :class:`LeaveMode` member
        :param muc_actor: The actor object if available.
        :type muc_actor: :class:`~.xso.UserActor`
        :param muc_reason: The reason for the cause, as given by the actor.
        :type muc_reason: :class:`str`
        :param muc_status_codes: The set of status codes received in the leave
            notification.
        :type muc_status_codes: :class:`~.abc.Set` of :class:`int` or
            :class:`~.StatusCode`

        When this signal is called, the `member` has already been removed from
        the :attr:`members`.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.10

            The `muc_status_codes` argument was added.

    .. signal:: on_muc_suspend()

        Emits when the stream used by this MUC gets destroyed (see
        :meth:`~.node.Client.on_stream_destroyed`) and the MUC is configured to
        automatically rejoin the user when the stream is re-established.

    .. signal:: on_muc_resume()

        Emits when the MUC is about to be rejoined on a new stream. This can be
        used by implementations to clear their MUC state, as it is emitted
        *before* any events like presence are emitted.

        The internal state of :class:`Room` is cleared before :meth:`on_resume`
        is emitted, which implies that presence events will be emitted for all
        occupants on re-join, independent on their presence before the
        connection was lost.

        Note that on a rejoin, all presence is re-emitted.

    .. signal:: on_muc_role_request(form, submission_future)

        Emits when an unprivileged occupant requests a role change and the
        MUC service wants this occupant to approve or deny it.

        :param form: The approval form as presented by the service.
        :type form: :class:`~.VoiceRequestForm`
        :param submission_future: A future to which the form to submit must
            be sent.
        :type submission_future: :class:`asyncio.Future`

        To decide on a role change request, a handler of this signal must
        fill in the form and set the form as a result of the
        `submission_future`.

        Once the result is set, the reply is sent by the MUC service
        automatically.

        It is required for signal handlers to check whether the
        `submission_future` is already done before processing the form (as it
        is possible that multiple handlers are connected to this signal).

    .. signal:: on_exit(*, muc_leave_mode=None, muc_actor=None, muc_reason=None, muc_status_codes=set(), **kwargs)

        Emits when the unavailable :class:`~.Presence` stanza for the
        local JID is received.

        :param muc_leave_mode: The cause of the removal.
        :type muc_leave_mode: :class:`LeaveMode` member
        :param muc_actor: The actor object if available.
        :type muc_actor: :class:`~.xso.UserActor`
        :param muc_reason: The reason for the cause, as given by the actor.
        :type muc_reason: :class:`str`
        :param muc_status_codes: The set of status codes received in the leave
            notification.
        :type muc_status_codes: :class:`~.abc.Set` of :class:`int` or
            :class:`~.StatusCode`

        .. note::

    The following signals inform users about state changes related to **other**
    occupants in the chat room. Note that different events may fire for the
    same presence stanza. A common example is a ban, which triggers
    :meth:`on_affiliation_change` (as the occupants affiliation is set to
    ``"outcast"``) and then :meth:`on_leave` (with :attr:`LeaveMode.BANNED`
    `mode`).

    .. signal:: on_muc_affiliation_changed(member, *, actor=None, reason=None, status_codes=set(), **kwargs)

        Emits when the affiliation of a `member` with the room changes.

        :param occupant: The member of the room.
        :type occupant: :class:`Occupant`
        :param actor: The actor object if available.
        :type actor: :class:`~.xso.UserActor`
        :param reason: The reason for the change, as given by the actor.
        :type reason: :class:`str`
        :param status_codes: The set of status codes received in the change
            notification.
        :type status_codes: :class:`~.abc.Set` of :class:`int` or
            :class:`~.StatusCode`

        `occupant` is the :class:`Occupant` instance tracking the occupant whose
        affiliation changed.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.10

            The `status_codes` argument was added.

    .. signal:: on_muc_role_changed(member, *, actor=None, reason=None, status_codes=set(), , **kwargs)

        Emits when the role of an `occupant` in the room changes.

        :param occupant: The member of the room.
        :type occupant: :class:`Occupant`
        :param actor: The actor object if available.
        :type actor: :class:`~.xso.UserActor`
        :param reason: The reason for the change, as given by the actor.
        :type reason: :class:`str`
        :param status_codes: The set of status codes received in the change
            notification.
        :type status_codes: :class:`~.abc.Set` of :class:`int` or
            :class:`~.StatusCode`

        `occupant` is the :class:`Occupant` instance tracking the occupant whose
        role changed.

        .. warning::

            Please read :ref:`api-tracking-memory`. This is especially relevant
            for MUCs because tracking is not guaranteed to work due to how
            :xep:`45` is written. It will work in many cases, probably in all
            cases you test during development, but it may fail to work for some
            individual messages and it may fail to work consistently for some
            services. See the implementation details below for reasons.

        The message is tracked and is considered
        :attr:`~.MessageState.DELIVERED_TO_RECIPIENT` when it is reflected back
        to us by the MUC service. The reflected message is then available in
        the :attr:`~.MessageTracker.response` attribute.

        .. note::

            Two things:

            1. The MUC service may change the contents of the message. An
               example of this is the Prosody developer MUC which replaces
               messages with more than a few lines with a pastebin link.
            2. Reflected messages which are caught by tracking are not emitted
               through :meth:`on_message`.

        There is no need to set the address attributes or the type of the
        message correctly; those will be overridden by this method to conform
        to the requirements of a message to the MUC. Other attributes are left
        untouched (except that :meth:`~.StanzaBase.autoset_id` is called) and
        can be used as desired for the message.

        .. warning::

            Using :meth:`send_message_tracked` before :meth:`on_join` has
            emitted will cause the `member` object in the resulting
            :meth:`on_message` event to be :data:`None` (the message will be
            delivered just fine).

            Using :meth:`send_message_tracked` before history replay is over
            will cause the :meth:`on_message` event to be emitted during
            history replay, even though everyone else in the MUC will -- of
            course -- only see the message after the history.

            :meth:`send_message` is not affected by these quirks.

        .. seealso::

            :meth:`.AbstractConversation.send_message_tracked` for the full
            interface specification.

        **Implementation details:** Currently, we try to detect reflected
        messages using two different criteria. First, if we see a message with
        the same message ID (note that message IDs contain 120 bits of entropy)
        as the message we sent, we consider it as the reflection. As some MUC
        services re-write the message ID in the reflection, as a fallback, we
        also consider messages which originate from the correct sender and have
        the correct body a reflection.

        Obviously, this fails consistently in MUCs which re-write the body and
        re-write the ID and randomly if the MUC always re-writes the ID but
        only sometimes the body.

        Join a multi-user chat at `mucjid` with `nick`. Return a :class:`Room`
        instance which is used to track the MUC locally and a
        :class:`aioxmpp.Future` which becomes done when the join succeeded
        (with a :data:`None` value) or failed (with an exception).

        In addition, the :meth:`~.ConversationService.on_conversation_added`
        signal is emitted immediately with the new :class:`Room`.

        It is recommended to attach the desired signals to the :class:`Room`
        before yielding next (e.g. in a non-deferred event handler to the
        :meth:`~.ConversationService.on_conversation_added` signal), to avoid
        races with the server. It is guaranteed that no signals are emitted
        before the next yield, and thus, it is safe to attach the signals right
        after :meth:`join` returned. (This is also the reason why :meth:`join`
        is not a coroutine, but instead returns the room and a future to wait
        for.)

        Any other interaction with the room must go through the :class:`Room`
        instance.

        If the multi-user chat at `mucjid` is already or currently being
        joined, the existing :class:`Room` and future is returned. The `nick`
        and other options for the new join are ignored.

        If the `mucjid` is not a bare JID, :class:`ValueError` is raised.

        `password` may be a string used as password for the MUC. It will be
        remembered and stored at the returned :class:`Room` instance.

        `history` may be a :class:`History` instance to request a specific
        amount of history; otherwise, the server will return a default amount
        of history.

        If `autorejoin` is true, the MUC will be re-joined after the stream has
        been destroyed and re-established. In that case, the service will
        request history since the stream destruction and ignore the `history`
        object passed here.

        If the stream is currently not established, the join is deferred until
        the stream is established.

          form = aioxmpp.muc.ConfigurationForm.from_xso(
              (await muc_service.get_room_config(mucjid))
          )
          form.moderatedroom = True
          await muc_service.set_rooom_config(mucjid, form.render_reply())

        .. versionadded:: 0.7
        """

        iq = aioxmpp.stanza.IQ(
            type_=aioxmpp.structs.IQType.SET,
            to=mucjid,
            payload=muc_xso.OwnerQuery(form=data),
        )

        yield from self.client.send(iq)
