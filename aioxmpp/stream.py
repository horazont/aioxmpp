:mod:`~aioxmpp.stream` --- Stanza stream
########################################

The stanza stream is the layer of abstraction above the XML stream. It deals
with sending and receiving stream-level elements, mainly stanzas. It also
handles stream liveness and stream management.

It provides ways to track stanzas on their way to the remote, as far as that is
possible.

.. autoclass:: StanzaStream

Low-level stanza tracking
=========================

The following classes are used to track stanzas in the XML stream to the
server. This is independent of things like `XEP-0184 Message Delivery
Receipts`__ (for which services are provided at :mod:`aioxmpp.tracking`); it
only provides tracking to the remote server and even that only if stream
management is used. Otherwise, it only provides tracking in the :mod:`aioxmpp`
internal queues.

    A stanza stream. This is the next layer of abstraction above the XMPP XML
    stream, which mostly deals with stanzas (but also with certain other
    stream-level elements, such as XEP-0198 Stream Management Request/Acks).

    It is independent from a specific :class:`~aioxmpp.protocol.XMLStream`
    instance. A :class:`StanzaStream` can be started with one XML stream,
    stopped later and then resumed with another XML stream. The user of the
    :class:`StanzaStream` has to make sure that the XML streams are compatible,
    identity-wise (use the same JID).

    `local_jid` may be the **bare** sender JID associated with the stanza
    stream. This is required for compatibility with ejabberd. If it is omitted,
    communication with ejabberd instances may not work.

    `loop` may be used to explicitly specify the :class:`asyncio.BaseEventLoop`
    to use, otherwise the current event loop is used.

    `base_logger` can be used to explicitly specify a :class:`logging.Logger`
    instance to fork off the logger from. The :class:`StanzaStream` will use a
    child logger of `base_logger` called ``StanzaStream``.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4

       The `local_jid` argument was added.

    The stanza stream takes care of ensuring stream liveness. For that, pings
    are sent in a periodic interval. If stream management is enabled, stream
    management ack requests are used as pings, otherwise XEP-0199 pings are
    used.

    The general idea of pinging is, to save computing power, to send pings only
    when other stanzas are also about to be sent, if possible. The time window
    for waiting for other stanzas is defined by
    :attr:`ping_opportunistic_interval`. The general time which the
    :class:`StanzaStream` waits between the reception of the previous ping and
    contemplating the sending of the next ping is controlled by
    :attr:`ping_interval`. See the attributes descriptions for details:

    .. attribute:: ping_interval = timedelta(seconds=15)

       A :class:`datetime.timedelta` instance which controls the time between a
       ping response and starting the next ping. When this time elapses,
       opportunistic mode is engaged for the time defined by
       :attr:`ping_opportunistic_interval`.

    .. attribute:: ping_opportunistic_interval = timedelta(seconds=15)

       This is the time interval after :attr:`ping_interval`. During that
       interval, :class:`StanzaStream` waits for other stanzas to be sent. If a
       stanza gets send during that interval, the ping is fired. Otherwise, the
       ping is fired after the interval.

    After a ping has been sent, the response must arrive in a time of
    :attr:`ping_interval` for the stream to be considered alive. If the
    response fails to arrive within that interval, the stream fails (see
    :attr:`on_failure`).

    Starting/Stopping the stream:

    .. automethod:: start

    .. automethod:: stop

    .. automethod:: wait_stop

    Inbound stanza filters allow to hook into the stanza processing by
    replacing, modifying or otherwise processing stanza contents *before* the
    above callbacks are invoked. With inbound stanza filters, there are no
    restrictions as to what processing may take place on a stanza, as no one
    but the stream may have references to its contents. See below for a
    guideline on when to use stanza filters.

    .. warning::

       Raising an exception from within a stanza filter kills the stream.

    Note that if a filter function drops an incoming stanza (by returning
    :data:`None`), it **must** ensure that the client still behaves RFC
    compliant.

    .. attribute:: app_inbound_presence_filter

       This is a :class:`AppFilter` based filter chain on inbound presence
       stanzas. It can be used to attach application-specific filters.

    .. attribute:: service_inbound_presence_filter

       This is another filter chain for inbound presence stanzas. It runs
       *before* the :attr:`app_inbound_presence_filter` chain and all functions
       registered there must have :class:`service.Service` *classes* as `order`
       value (see :meth:`Filter.register`).

       This filter chain is intended to be used by library services, such as a
       XEP-0115 implementation which may start a XEP-0030 lookup at the target
       entity to resolve the capability hash or prime the XEP-0030 cache with
       the service information obtained by interpreting the XEP-0115 hash
       value.

    .. attribute:: app_inbound_message_filter

       This is a :class:`AppFilter` based filter chain on inbound message
       stanzas. It can be used to attach application-specific filters.

    .. attribute:: service_inbound_message_filter

       This is the analogon of :attr:`service_inbound_presence_filter` for
       :attr:`app_inbound_message_filter`.

    Outbound stanza filters work similar to inbound stanza filters, but due to
    their location in the processing chain and possible interactions with
    senders of stanzas, there are some things to consider:

    * Per convention, a outbound stanza filter **must not** modify any child
      elements which are already present in the stanza when it receives the
      stanza.

      It may however add new child elements or remove existing child elements,
      as well as copying and *then* modifying existing child elements.

    * If the stanza filter replaces the stanza, it is responsible for making
      sure that the new stanza has appropriate
      :attr:`~.stanza.StanzaBase.from_`, :attr:`~.stanza.StanzaBase.to` and
      :attr:`~.stanza.StanzaBase.id` values. There are no checks to enforce
      this, because errorr handling at this point is peculiar. The stanzas will
      be sent as-is.

    * Similar to inbound filters, it is the responsibility of the filters that
      if stanzas are dropped, the client still behaves RFC-compliant.

    Now that you have been warned, here are the attributes for accessing the
    outbound filter chains. These otherwise work exactly like their inbound
    counterparts, but service filters run *after* application filters on
    outbound processing.

    .. attribute:: app_outbound_presence_filter

       This is a :class:`AppFilter` based filter chain on outbound presence
       stanzas. It can be used to attach application-specific filters.

       Before using this attribute, make sure that you have read the notes
       above.

    .. attribute:: service_outbound_presence_filter

       This is the analogon of :attr:`service_inbound_presence_filter`, but for
       outbound presence. It runs *after* the
       :meth:`app_outbound_presence_filter`.

       Before using this attribute, make sure that you have read the notes
       above.

    .. attribute:: app_outbound_message_filter

       This is a :class:`AppFilter` based filter chain on inbound message
       stanzas. It can be used to attach application-specific filters.

       Before using this attribute, make sure that you have read the notes
       above.

    .. attribute:: service_outbound_messages_filter

       This is the analogon of :attr:`service_outbound_presence_filter`, but
       for outbound messages.

       Before using this attribute, make sure that you have read the notes
       above.

    When to use stanza filters? In general, applications will rarely need
    them. However, services may make profitable use of them, and it is a
    convenient way for them to inspect incoming or outgoing stanzas without
    having to take up the registration slots (remember that
    :meth:`register_message_callback` et. al. only allow *one* callback per
    designator).

    In general, whenever you do something which *supplements* the use of the
    stanza with respect to the RFC but does not fulfill the orignial intent of
    the stanza, it is advisable to use a filter instead of a callback on the
    actual stanza.

    Vice versa, if you were to develop a service which manages presence
    subscriptions, it would be more correct to use
    :meth:`register_presence_callback`; this prevents other services which try
    to do the same from conflicting with you. You would then provide callbacks
    to the application to let it learn about presence subscriptions.

    .. autoattribute:: local_jid

    Signals:

    .. signal:: on_failure(exc)

       occurs whenever the main task of the :class:`StanzaStream` (the one
       started by :meth:`start`) terminates with an exception.

       Examples are :class:`ConnectionError` as raised upon a ping timeout and
       any exceptions which may be raised by the
       :meth:`aioxmpp.protocol.XMLStream.send_xso` method.

       The exception which occured is given as `exc`.

    .. signal:: on_stream_destroyed()

       When a stream is destroyed so that all state shall be discarded (for
       example, pending futures), this signal is fired.

       This happens if a non-SM stream is stopped or if SM is being disabled.

    .. signal:: on_stream_established()

       When a stream is newly established, this signal is fired. This happens
       whenever a non-SM stream is started and whenever a stream which
       previously had SM disabled is started with SM enabled.

        value for the :attr:`.stanza.IQ.payload` attribute. The value will be
        set as the payload attribute value of an IQ response (with type
        ``"result"``) which is generated and sent by the stream.

        If the coroutine raises an exception, it will be converted to a
        :class:`~.stanza.Error` object. That error object is then used as
        payload for an IQ response (with type ``"error"``) which is generated
        and sent by the stream.

        If the exception is a subclass of :class:`aioxmpp.errors.XMPPError`, it
        is converted to an :class:`~.stanza.Error` instance
        directly. Otherwise, it is wrapped in a
        :class:`aioxmpp.errors.XMPPCancelError` with ``undefined-condition``.

        `payload_cls`) pair, :class:`ValueError` is raised.
