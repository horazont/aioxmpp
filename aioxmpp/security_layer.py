:mod:`~aioxmpp.security_layer` --- Implementations to negotiate stream security
####################################################################################

This module provides different implementations of the security layer
(TLS+SASL).

These are coupled, as different SASL features might need different TLS features
(such as channel binding or client cert authentication). The preferred method
to construct a :class:`SecurityLayer` is using the :func:`make` function.
:class:`SecurityLayer` objects are needed to establish an XMPP connection,
for example using :class:`aioxmpp.Client`.

.. autofunction:: make

.. autoclass:: PinType

.. autofunction:: tls_with_password_based_authentication(password_provider, [ssl_context_factory], [max_auth_attempts=3])

.. autoclass:: SecurityLayer(ssl_context_factory, certificate_verifier_factory, tls_required, sasl_providers)

.. autofunction:: negotiate_sasl

Certificate verifiers
=====================

To verify the peer certificate provided by the server, different
:class:`CertificateVerifier`\ s are available:

.. autoclass:: PKIXCertificateVerifier

To implement your own verifiers, see the documentation at the base class for
certificate verifiers:

.. autoclass:: CertificateVerifier

Certificate and key pinning
---------------------------

Often in the XMPP world, we need certificate or public key pinning, as most
XMPP servers do not have certificates trusted by the usual certificate
stores. This module also provide certificate verifiers which can be used for
that purpose, as well as stores for saving the pinned information.

.. autoclass:: PinningPKIXCertificateVerifier

.. autoclass:: CertificatePinStore

.. autoclass:: PublicKeyPinStore

Base classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For future expansion or customization, the base classes of the above utilities
can be subclassed and extended:

.. autoclass:: HookablePKIXCertificateVerifier

.. autoclass:: AbstractPinStore

.. _sasl providers:

SASL providers
==============

As elements of the `sasl_providers` argument to :class:`SecurityLayer`,
instances of the following classes can be used:

.. autoclass:: PasswordSASLProvider

.. autoclass:: AnonymousSASLProvider

.. note::

   Patches welcome for additional :class:`SASLProvider` implementations.

Abstract base classes
=====================

For implementation of custom SASL providers, the following base class can be
used:

.. autoclass:: SASLProvider

Deprecated functionality
========================

In pre-0.6 code, you might find use of the following things:

.. autofunction:: security_layer

.. autoclass:: STARTTLSProvider

class HookablePKIXCertificateVerifier(CertificateVerifier):
    """
    This PKIX-based verifier has several hooks which allow overriding of the
    checking process, for example to implement key or certificate pinning.

    It provides three callbacks:

    * `quick_check` is a synchronous callback (and must be a plain function)
      which is called from :meth:`verify_callback`. It is only called if the
      certificate fails full PKIX verification, and only for certain cases. For
      example, expired certificates do not get a second chance and are rejected
      immediately.

      It is called with the leaf certificate as its only argument. It must
      return :data:`True` if the certificate is known good and should pass the
      verification. If the certificate is known bad and should fail the
      verification immediately, it must return :data:`False`.

      If the certificate is unknown and the check should be deferred to the
      `post_handshake_deferred_failure` callback, :data:`None` must be
      returned.

      Passing :data:`None` to `quick_check` is the same as if a callable passed
      to `quick_check` would return :data:`None` always (i.e. the decision is
      deferred).

    * `post_handshake_deferred_failure` must be a coroutine. It is called after
      the handshake is done but before the STARTTLS negotiation has finished
      and allows the application to take more time to decide on a certificate
      and possibly request user input.

      The coroutine receives the verifier instance as its argument and can make
      use of all the verification attributes to present the user with a
      sensible choice.

      If `post_handshake_deferred_failure` is :data:`None`, the result is
      identical to returning :data:`False` from the callback.

    * `post_handshake_success` is only called if the certificate has passed the
      verification (either because it flawlessly passed by OpenSSL or the
      `quick_check` callback returned :data:`True`).

      You may pass :data:`None` to this argument to disable the callback
      without any further side effects.

    The following attributes are available when the post handshake callbacks
    are called:

    .. attribute:: recorded_errors

       This is a :class:`set` with tuples consisting of a
       :class:`OpenSSL.crypto.X509` instance, an OpenSSL error number and the
       depth of the certificate in the verification chain (0 is the leaf
       certificate).

       It is a collection of all errors which were passed into
       :meth:`verify_callback` by OpenSSL.

    .. attribute:: hostname_matches

       This is :data:`True` if the host name in the leaf certificate matches
       the domain part of the JID for which we are connecting (i.e. the usual
       server name check).

    .. attribute:: leaf_x509

       The :class:`OpenSSL.crypto.X509` object which represents the leaf
       certificate.

    .. warning::

        When using any argument except `password_provider`, be sure to read
        its documentation below the following overview **carefully**. Many
        arguments can be used to shoot yourself in the foot easily, while
        violating all security expectations.

    Args:

        password_provider (:class:`str` or coroutine function):
            Password source to authenticate with.

    Keyword Args:
        pin_store (:class:`dict` or :class:`AbstractPinStore`):
            Enable use of certificate/public key pinning. `pin_type` controls
            the type of store used when a dict is passed instead of a pin store
            object.
        pin_type (:class:`~aioxmpp.security_layer.PinType`):
            Type of pin store to create when `pin_store` is a dict.
        post_handshake_deferred_failure (coroutine function):
            Coroutine callback to invoke when using certificate pinning and the
            verification of the certificate was not possible using either PKIX
            or the pin store.
        anonymous (:class:`str`, :data:`None` or :data:`False`):
            trace token for SASL ANONYMOUS (:rfc:`4505`); passing a
            non-:data:`False` value enables ANONYMOUS authentication.
        ssl_context_factory (function): Factory function to create the SSL
            context used to establish transport layer security. Defaults to
            :func:`aioxmpp.security_layer.default_ssl_context`.
        no_verify (:class:`bool`): *Disable* all certificate verification.
            Usage is **strongly discouraged** outside controlled test
            environments. See below for alternatives.

    Raises:

        RuntimeError: if `anonymous` is not :data:`False` and the version of
            :mod:`aiosasl` does not support ANONYMOUS authentication.

    Returns:
        :class:`SecurityLayer`: object holding the entire security layer
            configuration

    `password_provider` must either be a coroutine function or a :class:`str`.
    As a coroutine function, it is called during authentication with the JID we
    are trying to authenticate against as the first, and the sequence number of
    the authentication attempt as second argument. The sequence number starts
    at 0. The coroutine is expected to return :data:`None` or a password. See
    :class:`PasswordSASLProvider` for details. If `password_provider` is a
    :class:`str`, a coroutine which returns the string on the first and
    :data:`None` on subsequent attempts is created and used.

    If `pin_store` is not :data:`None`, :class:`PinningPKIXCertificateVerifier`
    is used instead of the default :class:`PKIXCertificateVerifier`. The
    `pin_store` argument determines the pinned certificates: if it is a
    dictionary, a :class:`AbstractPinStore` according to the :class:`PinType`
    passed as `pin_type` argument is created and initialised with the data from
    the dictionary using its :meth:`~AbstractPinStore.import_from_json` method.
    Otherwise, `pin_store` must be a :class:`AbstractPinStore` instance which
    is passed to the verifier.

    `post_handshake_deferred_callback` is used only if `pin_store` is not
    :data:`None`. It is passed to the equally-named argument of
    :class:`PinningPKIXCertificateVerifier`, see the documentation there for
    details on the semantics. If `post_handshake_deferred_callback` is
    :data:`None` while `pin_store` is not, a coroutine which returns
    :data:`False` is substituted.

    `ssl_context_factory` can be a callable taking no arguments and returning
    a :class:`OpenSSL.SSL.Context` object. If given, the factory will be used
    to obtain an SSL context when the stream negotiates transport layer
    security via TLS. By default,
    :func:`aioxmpp.security_layer.default_ssl_context` is used, which should be
    fine for most applications.

    .. warning::

        The :func:`~.default_ssl_context` implementation sets important
        defaults. It is **strongly recommended** to use the context returned
        by :func:`~.default_ssl_context` and modify it, instead of creating
        a new context from scratch when implementing your own factory.

    If `no_verify` is true, none of the above regarding certificate verifiers
    matters. The internal null verifier is used, which **disables certificate
    verification completely**.

    .. warning::

        Disabling certificate verification makes your application vulnerable to
        trivial Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Do **not** use this outside
        controlled test environments or when you know **exactly** what youâ€™re
        doing!

        If you need to handle certificates which cannot be verified using the
        public key infrastructure, consider making use of the `pin_store`
        argument instead.

    `anonymous` may be a string or :data:`False`. If it is not :data:`False`,
    :class:`AnonymousSASLProvider` is used before password based authentication
    is attempted. In addition, it is allowed to set `password_provider` to
    :data:`None`. `anonymous` is the trace token to use, and SHOULD be the
    empty string (as specified by :xep:`175`). This requires :mod:`aiosasl` 0.3
    or newer.

    .. note::

        :data:`False` and ``""`` are treated differently for the `anonymous`
        argument, despite both being false-y values!

    .. note::

        If `anonymous` is not :data:`False` and `password_provider` is not
        :data:`None`, both authentication types are attempted. Anonymous
        authentication is, in that case, preferred over password-based
        authentication.

        If you need to reverse the order, you have to construct your own
        :class:`SecurityLayer` object.

    .. warning::

        Take the security and privacy considerations from :rfc:`4505` (which
        specifies the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism) and :xep:`175` (which discusses
        the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism in the XMPP context) into account before
        using `anonymous`.

    The versatility and simplicity of use of this function make (pun intended)
    it the preferred way to construct :class:`SecurityLayer` instances.
